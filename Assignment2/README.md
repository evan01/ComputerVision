#Computer Vision - A2

Firstly my apologies for not getting Jupiter to work very well. I was unable to get it to output images but I found another way of displaying them

Instead, I'll just place my image output files inside of .html files for you to look at.
I don't mind additionally running this code in front of you live to prove that it does work.

Below are the things to look at for each part of the assignment
###Part 1.1 Harris Corners
Output Images: HarrisCorners.html
Code: In the main.ipynb file but better to read the HarrisCorners.py (copied into ipynb file)

###Part 1.2 Feature Matching
Output Images: FeatureMatcher.html
Code: In the main.ipynb file but better to read the FeatureMatching.py file

###Part 2 Face Matching
Output Images: FaceMatching.html
Code: In the main.ipynb file but better to read the FaceMatching.py file

#### Final Comments
Please let me know if there is anything that doesn't make sense or you need to talk to me about.
Everything worked well when I ran it so I have no problem explaining how I did anything
I'll try hard to get jupiter to work next time, but I'm out of time to get it 100% now

PS: The picture logger is just a wrapper interface to the visual logging library, which is amazing for openCV
I found it much better than using iPython and Jupyter. It was the best I could do with the time I had.
