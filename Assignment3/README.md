Hi there! Thanks for reading this. Everything should work from the main.ipynb file, 
I justed tested everything and the outputs were great.
Additionally, if the ipynb file does not work (it really should), the
 code is also in the panorama_mine.py file and the Segmentation.py file.
 
 I tried to label the correct section of the code using the markdown headings so hopefully that works for you.
 
 Thanks again and please email me at evan.knox@mail.mcgill.ca if you have any trouble getting this to work.
